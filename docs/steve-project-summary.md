# Steve Project Summary

## Project Overview
Steve is a cloud-based personal assistant platform designed as a wrapper around mcpomni-connect, allowing it to leverage multiple language models for task automation and assistance. Deployed via CloudFormation and functioning as a "head intern," Steve provides a standardized, extensible alternative to Emma (which is built around Claude Code).

## Key Deliverables

### Design Documents
- [High-Level Design](/home/emma-user/steve-design.md) - System architecture and components
- [Implementation Plan](/home/emma-user/steve-implementation-plan.md) - Development roadmap and timeline
- [CloudFormation Template](/home/emma-user/steve-cf-template.yaml) - Infrastructure as code
- [Component Comparison](/home/emma-user/steve-comparison.md) - Steve vs. Emma analysis

### Implementation
- [Steve CLI](/home/emma-user/steve-cli.js) - Command-line interface for mcpomni-connect
- [Persona Configuration](/home/emma-user/steve-persona.json) - Steve persona definition
- [Package Configuration](/home/emma-user/steve-package.json) - npm package setup

### Documentation
- [Test Plan](/home/emma-user/steve-test-plan.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy
- [Installation Guide](/home/emma-user/steve-installation.md) - Deployment and setup

## Architecture Highlights

### Core Components
1. **CloudFormation Stack** - Automated EC2 bastion host deployment
2. **Steve CLI Wrapper** - Node.js-based wrapper for mcpomni-connect
3. **MCP Integration Layer** - Unified interface to multiple MCPs
4. **Persona System** - Configurable assistant personalities
5. **Background Processing** - Long-running task management

### Key Differentiators from Emma
- **Multi-Model Support** - Can leverage multiple AI models via mcpomni-connect
- **Standardized Deployment** - CloudFormation for consistent infrastructure
- **Task-Centric Design** - Focused on automation rather than conversation
- **Extensible Architecture** - Designed for easy MCP and tool additions

## Implementation Details

### CloudFormation Template
The template provisions:
- t4g.medium EC2 instance with 4GB RAM
- IAM roles with necessary permissions
- S3 bucket for data storage
- Security groups for SSH access
- Automated setup and configuration

### Steve CLI
Implemented in Node.js with:
- Command parsing via Commander
- Persona loading and application
- Routine management
- Background processing
- MCP integration layer

### Persona System
JSON-based configuration defining:
- Communication style and tone
- Skill sets and capabilities
- Boundaries and limitations
- Daily routines and workflows

## Deployment Process
1. Deploy CloudFormation stack with user parameters
2. Connect to EC2 instance via SSH
3. Authenticate with required MCPs
4. Configure personal routines and preferences
5. Begin using Steve via command line

## Testing Strategy
The comprehensive test plan includes:
- Unit tests for CLI components
- Integration tests for MCP connections
- System tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests under expected load

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term Enhancements
- Voice interface integration
- Mobile companion app
- Advanced scheduling capabilities
- Document processing improvements

### Long-term Vision
- Multi-user support
- Enterprise deployment options
- Ecosystem of Steve extensions
- Smart home integration

## Project Status
This project has completed the design and planning phase. The implementation includes:
- Complete system architecture
- CLI implementation 
- Persona definition
- CloudFormation template
- Package configuration
- Comprehensive documentation

The next steps include:
1. Infrastructure validation testing
2. Integration with actual MCPs
3. Performance optimization
4. User acceptance testing

## Conclusion
Steve represents a significant evolution in personal assistant technology, offering a model-agnostic alternative to Emma with standardized deployment and a focus on task automation. The platform's extensible design and CloudFormation-based deployment make it suitable for individual users and teams requiring consistent assistant capabilities.
